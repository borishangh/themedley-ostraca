# The Medley

The Medley is an International Literary Journal publishing semi-annually since 2018. It is run entirely by the students of Hansraj College, University of Delhi and staffed by the members of the Creative Writing Society, Ostraca.

I oversaw publishing of the 9th Issue of The Medley, themed "Debris" as the Editor-in-chief. During this time, the establishing members of the journal had passed out and we needed a site to host our earlier issue(at the time mantained on Wix at a subscription model).

In the spirit of a student-run initiative, we felt the need to host the pieces on an independant platform that we had control over. So I created [themedley.in]([url](https://themedley.in/)). 

The site runs on a JAM stack with all the stability of markdown files, I have been mantaining it since.
