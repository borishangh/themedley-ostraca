Punjab wails
borders turn red
a storyteller collects letters
left behind
no stamps. no addresses.
she hides them in bloodstained wells
nostalgia becomes an antidote for amnesia.
at night, the well overflows with tales
flooding the city with memory.
the radio comes alive
asking
are you listening?
are you breathing?
