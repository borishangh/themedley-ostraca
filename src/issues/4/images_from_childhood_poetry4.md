The memory quickly fades into origin:
days of sunlit, ashen mornings, and the golden –

bouncing off the copperware, the field of green,
chiseling away the edges, the teeth-like irregularities,

and softening June with the colour of setting suns.
Surrendering to the shape of birds at twilight,

and us – little figurines, hands a mess of bones,
Bodies tumbling towards another fate.

This was back when we couldn’t separate
the glow from the sun, the fire from the spectacle –

younger versions of the same self,
stuck in a heaven of their own making.

And the solitary image, stuck like a riddle in my head:
you, running towards and running away,

And your little hand – a fist around mine,

Tight and tangible and dreamy,

like an aftermath of some great frenzy.
And the house, still surviving, breathing with wind,

existing not as some painting or a photograph,
but a structure, a monument, that lived on

even when the sunsets, and the birds and us -
all had stood up and left.
