In Eunice no trees grow
There are sand hills
And as in Jal and Hobbs mistakes
 
As in Jal and Hobbs families mourn
Where we were five
One says now we are four
 
In Eunice wind shifts sand
But the hills do not leave
Mistakes are made people grieve
 
Where we were five we are four
Where he is we do not know
In Eunice no trees grow
