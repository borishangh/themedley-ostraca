The days are peeling off 
like a scorch is shedding
its outer skin, to give space 
and support to the new layer,
But it still hurts.

The shadow seem ebbing away 
in the light of the sun,
Insooth, it is evanescing into 
that ever widening encrust 
of heart's rock-bottom
never to be found again.
But to be trans-formed.

The lust to meet new people
is so lost in time,
like a toddler loses interest 
in toys of youthful joy.
It loves them.
But still throws them away.

The chilly winter breeze 
frightens like succumbing 
oneself to tuberculosis,
slowly and obliviously.
But still one lives.

The hope for hope is lost,
it sleeps unwarily, 
unflappable and untouched 
by the daily wars 
of pity nuisance
fought by instigators.
But it still exists somewhere.

And in this charade of emotions,
the one baffling emotion is 
to sit in front of a screen
listening to creaking 'voices'
and gazing 'faces' 
which feel the same, 
but still do nothing.
