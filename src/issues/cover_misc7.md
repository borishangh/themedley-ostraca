For me, photography is not just about a simple click of the capture button—it’s about treasuring the moments for eternity. Through the captured realities, one can travel back in time. This is what I have always found fascinating about pictures. Whenever one looks through an old album, they find themselves soaked in the memory and happenings of that time. Photographs tend to serve as a medium of bringing blurred memories to the fore and weaving a story along with them. 

This photograph is of a place where millions of stories breathe and come to life, a most spectacular library established in New Delhi. As I was moving across the hall, I happened to look above, and that’s when my feet couldn’t move any further. The magnificence and the complexity of the structure had such a beguiling power that I couldn’t resist recording the moment in the pages of my photography journal. It was surprising that a structure that had appeared simple, at first, could turn into such an intricately woven design. The spiralling shape of the ceiling with reflective window panes on the periphery held a multitude of narratives, ideas, and tales of all flavours behind them. 

The picture, to me, is a representation of the convoluted shapes that our life takes us through, and of the layers of realities upon which our existence rests. It corresponds to the theme of layers as a place of multifarious shapes and labyrinthine emotions.
