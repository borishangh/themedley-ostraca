The windows churn the sunlight
They provide only bleakness
Every filtered thing is poisoned
Every made thing is  cursed 

Here are the truths I state as verses
Do they spark bewilderment?

The boxes were full of her clothes,
They ate the jewelry that my mother never wore,
They kept the torn sarees warm,
But I didn't take them with me.

Without a body, leaving a space sounds unholy
Without a body, possessions aren't possessions
Anymore.

I left the boxes
They are in the hall room
On the piece of the floor where my mother was to turn into ash

How can I take the belongings away from a place
That has carried her air?>
