The Medley has been many things in its lifetime, and wandered to many places before it was here. A blog. A newsletter. An academic journal. And then, a title, a word. Itâ€™s trajectory towards publishing has been one full of breaks and pauses and jumps and spurts. And finally, it got here. A literary journal, devoted to creative expression and art, one that explores the human experience and maps the countless internal monologues that we create in our heads.

The conception and curation of this inaugural issue, with the contributors being of Hansraj College, University of Delhi, has centrally evolved around the kind of work we thought people would like to read. There are celebrations of Indian narratives, etchings of personal landscapes, discourses on social issues in these pieces. There are articles that put themselves out there, ready to be read, understood, talked about. These pieces are brave in the sense writing as an act can be brave, and have all been done so well.

This journal has been the collective effort of numerous people, but the contributors remain our pillar of support. We would not be here without any of those poems, stories, or articles. It took us a long time and a lot of effort to arrive at this juncture and we fervently hope that the fruits of our hard work and labour are sweet and you enjoy reading all that you see here. This introductory first issue is but a peak into what all we have in store for you with subsequent issues and installments. We aspire to meet, challenge, and overshoot your expectations. Happy Reading!
