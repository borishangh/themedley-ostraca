it is just and right that the people should rebel
stand up for themselves
take to the streets

this noxious air has choked the life out of our lungs
and we will stuff the beaks
of our plague masks

we will breathe in lavender oils, and bathe in bleach
our skin will dry, and crack, and peel
and we emerge purified

behind the walls of our home where we are safe
six feet apart from the infection,
young enough to carry it,

not old enough to die, but rather to become lethal
masked by the red death,
let us stay alive inside

our lives rendered little by this fear, pressed into these paper houses
counting eggs, and sugar grains
heads down

out in the streets, are the righteous few, who scream
it is my right, to die of this plague
and you canâ€™t take it away

it is just and right that the people should rebel
but a plague is not a government
its oppression is universal

a beer garden is not a fundamental human right
a foreign holiday is not a political cause
we stuff the beaks of our masks

we pray the miasma passes soon,
we obey.
we wait.
