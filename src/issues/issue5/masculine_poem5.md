Men are the proprietors of power and so
claiming anger as masculine assets
and violence with it, are not accustomed
to feminine display of disdain or displeasure
(or bloodlust, rage, vengeance, and wrath)
An angry woman disqualifies herself from womanhood,
just by being angry.
Her intellect is nullified by her inconvenient instinct
but a manâ€™s anger is fuel for his logic, his passion.
He is raised to expect a servile female, to anticipate
compliant cunts with mastery over unfathomable patience.

He creates
the dual gendered world: male or not male
the dual gendered world: human or not human
the dual gendered world: respectable or exploitable
