 I apologize for all that I disturb
 when I'm out walking.
 Sorry, flock of starlings.
 for interrupting your feast.
 I regret, young German Shepherd,
 that my presence set you off barking.
 I’m a most repentant man
 when it comes to the grass I trample,
 the flowers I brush aside,
 the sidewalk cement that
 takes the full weight of me
 and the glass storefront
 that must endure a wretched, forlorn breath.
 And people, don't get me started on people.
 All of my remorse goes out to
 the strangers who must step aside,
 disrupt their pleasant thoughts
 for a moment or two
 of pavement traffic cop.
 And, worse still, is when I come across
 someone I know.
 Add the time for acknowledgement,
 for talk, worse still, for later arrangements,
 to the great act of contrition:
 me being in their life.
 Would you believe some even love me.
 They even love the poor example I set.
