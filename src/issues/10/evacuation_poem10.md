To prepare for Evacuation Day,
set out the outfit I’ll pull on fast,
gather what I can’t let go of
into my survival backpack, 
the handful of my children’s baby teeth
in the zipper pouch I saved them in,
stamped Khanna Jewelers,
Khanna Bhawan, Bank Street,
Karol Bagh, N. Delhi, resting in the tiny drawer 
of an intricately carved Japanese jewelry box, 
leftovers from my ex-life 
with the son of a diplomat.
From the time before
the words she said to me last 
stood stiff in the vase of my memory,
“Hello? Hello?”—silence on the line—
and I started surrounding myself with reminders 
of loves gone by,
like a person sitting on the sidewalk amidst her trashbags,
begging for her right to remain. We old 
 
colorize our black-and-white pasts so
in the recesses of our brains they take on a glow,
so phrases tossed out way back when emerge
in a chemical bath, the way pictures came gradually clear 
in days gone by.
If the old one wrests himself free
from the polarities: predator/prey, suffering/joy,
that pin his arms to his sides and hobble his gait, 
if he’s free to run up and down the spectrum,
a renegade laughing and carrying on—
“Never surrender!” he cries to the smoke-filled air.
 
I’m used to drawing out the hardest stories, 
bringing them to my face but no one else
likes their breath snatched. “So tether yourself!
Adjust your eyes to the lenses!”
Let stone after stone in the edifice of my life liquify and evaporate,
like souls leaving, turning their bodies to meat. 
I’m used to telling
 
how we were a couple
ecstatic about getting into things—
bed, marriage, costumes, debt.
How a day would come in—Hello!—and we’d get into it.
How a day would sail out like a steamship. 
“This is the last stop on this day!” the announcer would pompously bellow.
“Everyone please leave this day!” 
We old have stowed away in the corners
of days that returned to the port.
The question pulls on the old blankets of consciousness 
we’re hiding under,
that the young party to avoid noticing:
if you’re neither predator nor prey 
what are you? The delusion—“My brain is a new thing
under the sun”—takes its leave.
The time to fly is coming,
from the nest of the things assuring me that I’ve lived.
