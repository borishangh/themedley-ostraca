My friend my shadow reads to me; its chin bobs in time
to the voice emanating from my mouth;
I hold a standard above my head like a barbell
like a child in a flood;
I press care to me through the hail blowing through me 
to remember the feel of it, 
like the outcast wandering the tundra 
warmed by the sight of a candle 
in a far distant window;
I wait for the announcement ricocheting around the station like the voice of god
saying a train is coming. A weight is bearing down.
Look into that weight
that sodden cloud roiling—
look, a regime gutting language.
A bone porous enough to absorb it
the last thing
I expected the last thing
I thought would be comforting.
Navigating observing describing reporting 
the tunnel
of light next door.
I hew to the figure in it
writing down his email, 
to a train of thought I’m hanging by,
a thread, 
turning to see what’s tapping 
my shoulder, it’s dire news, 
without knowing where it ends,
in a clearing   a pit   a dry well   a dining room
a bedroom lit with a candle. What will dying alone
be like?
What would someone taking down
my story,
keeping fragments—former homes, Dad driving the Rambler—be like?
When a body is fettered what remains free
when a people is scooped up like detritus and deposited,
when it’s one of the dead who speaks with me from the pages, 
when I push the text back into him 
and take his body instead?
A concert I shuffle to through snow in poverty’s fetters is being given, 
my trust in it as translucent
as a scattering of scales
