*After The Last Kingdom*

Think of Uhtred and Brida
ever running across a paper cut:

a sword failing to absolve itself
of the crimson stain it skims into.

She sits with him on dismal stairs
and trauma bonds - 

sleeps with him on yearning dreams - 
that lover in Aldous' *Brave New Wolrd*

who suffers the allegorical deaths
of his phantoms.

*To kill you would be to kill a part of,*
myself but you bear a role to fall

in engulfing vengeance so that he may
sob in the vanity of victory at last.
