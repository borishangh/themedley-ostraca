We drive back to the farm every year
On the Summer Solstice
Everyone in the family
Young
Old
Close
Distant
Meets for a reunion
Of sorts
 
On the drive
There’s no talking
No radio
No singing
Just silence
 
Near sunset
We gather in the old barn
Stars start to peek through the holes in the roof
The warmth of the day
Never permeating the shadows of the barn
We all look at each other blandly
With tired eyes
We know what comes next
 
Uncle Dan stands on a hay bale
Just a farmer in plaid shirt and overalls
Fresh mud on his rubber boots
A bucket of flashlights is passed around
Uncle Dan clears his throat
 
“OK, gang. You know the drill.”
We file out the back of the barn
Flashlights bobbing along as we head towards the woods
At the back of the property
 
Approaching the family plot
Only the crunching of twigs and dry leaves under booted feet
Even the children are silent
Old stone slabs mark the resting places of our ancestors
Impossibly old and faded
Covered with leaves and overgrown grass
 
We spread out
The plot is large enough that none of us are within the distance our fingertips can reach
Onto our knees on the oddly spongy ground
 
Flashlights turn off one by one
Total darkness aside from the rising moon
I can hear the sounds of my family around me
Strangely soothing
I reach my hand out and lovingly caress the stone that bears the name of my great-great grandmother, Louise
They say I look like her
 
I hesitate just a moment longer
Listening to the muffled grunts of my cousin to the left of me
I grab handful after handful of soil
Shoving it into my mouth
Crying as I swallow
The moist loamy grime
Soon my duty will be complete
Until next summer
