The wind doesn’t blow here anymore.
We banished it by statute years ago
and for good measure outlawed breezes
 
although they are slippery and often
attempt entry into our calm environs
by masquerading as group exhalations.
 
We know better, of course, but the effort
it would take to capture them would be
excessive, and therefore not worth our time.
 
Things do tend to be more pungent here,
but we assume that is their intended
nature and not our imposition of stasis.
 
This morning a leaf tore helter skelter
down my quiet street, and I, shocked,
took search of the child whose foot
 
impelled it, but youth have an agility
our more febrile minds cannot attain,
and he was gone like the breeze
 
that comes to a screeching halt
at our jurisdictional limits, afraid
of the consequences we would impose,
 
and we turn up our collars in the chill wind
which we imagine nature would intend
were we not her legal master and forbidden it.
