*(after Reza Bariheni “Cemetery”)*
 
 
The unmarked graves of kids crushed in the rubble
might not be identified with the passage of time
but future archeologists may
discover a chard of shrapnel
rattling in the child’s empty skull
like a marble
and send it to a criminologist
so that at least
the evidentiary stage of the tragedy
will be brought to the world’s attention
and lawyers and scholars will argue
or introduce laws and human rights reports
connecting this marble to a dark and mindless era;
that is Gaza since October 7, 2023
it was a dark and mindless time
when reporters asked and historians chronicled,
or chatted on late-night talk shows
and brought to the world’s attention
the culprit of COVID’s deadly toll
then shared the results with the world
so that wise epidemiologists could discover
from medical records of uninformed Americans
a missed opportunity to save lives
and with the passage of time, investigate and re-examine
clues to determine that a million tragic deaths
due to COVID complications
were caused by the belligerent asshole in the White House.
