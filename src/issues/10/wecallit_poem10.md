The first daag bloomed quietly —
not on my skin, but in my voice,
a tremble I mistook for childhood.

Mother stitched silence into my collars,
told me, “Hold your tongue.
Girls who speak leave stains.”

I wore that silence to school,
ironed it sharp so it wouldn’t wrinkle
when I smiled.

Our house smelled of burnt rice
and things unsaid.
The clock ticked like a warning.
Even the light had to knock.

Grandma’s portrait hung crooked —
not by mistake,
but as if even the wall
couldn’t carry her memory straight.

At night, I’d listen to mother cry
through two doors and a generation.
Her sobs, a lullaby
that never learned how to end.
