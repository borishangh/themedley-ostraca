Antelope, hunters â€“
            ancient cave wall
drawings of charcoal,
            red and green ochre. 

Pyramids, great walls,
            cathedrals, castles,
backyard sheds
            and arbors. 

Plantings, sprouts, orchids,
            conservatories,
vegetable gardens,
            giant sequoias. 

Carefully crafted words,
            handed down
on paper, digitally, told,
            retold. 

Songs of minstrels, choirs,
            street performers,
operas, recorded, played
            back, improvised. 

Piecing together
            mosaics, quilts.
Threading embroidery,
            tapestries.

Kiss joined to kiss.
            Ring slid on finger.
Celebrations and photos
            from every angle. 

Memories remembered,
            restored.  Stories
told, retold.  The need
            not to be forgotten.
