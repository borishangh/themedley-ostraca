surrounded by lesser blooms
the tulip shows off its stripes
product of genetic defect
compounded by disease
conferring extreme value on its bulbs

those lesser blooms, sturdier
than hothouse flowers
may be inferior in monetary worth
but have sufficient brightness
to cast shadows on the elite blossom

heading the pack, a lone carnation
mimics the colours of the tulip
usurps its prime position, even now
the droop begins in petal and leaf
until still life becomes variegated death
