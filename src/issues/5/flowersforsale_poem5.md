not feeling recently
so very inspired
in spite of birds
which wheel and scatter
on the sky
like salt on bacon.

things wilt
in the wrong
conditions. flowers
on sale
half-price at a newsagent.

a city pent up
like leaves in a doorway,
spread out below me
and crunching with aches,
aching to be touched
and be touched
and be touched.
