         If what they said
          Was interesting
And their interests
Were what they said

         I’d listen.
If their “rights”
        Were right-
Their morals moral-
Their justice just

        I’d trust.

If their rules made sense
                 And sense ruled-
If their laws
                 Weren’t so broken

           I wouldn’t break them.
   They can beat me
          imprison me
                  fine me
        and sentence me to death.

   But they can’t punish me
                  without my consent.

   For I’m a masochist
            recluse
           bankrupt
         and suicidal.

So how do you like that?
