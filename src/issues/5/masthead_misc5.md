        <div class="masthead-text">Areeb Ahmad is currently struggling through the final year of an undergraduate degree in English Literature from the University of Delhi. Although he is an eclectic bookworm, he swears by all things SFF with Erikson as God and Malazan as Gospel. Areeb has been writing since he was in sixth grade and would like to finish a book of his own one of these days. When he is not occupied with sleeping/eating/reading, he can either be found desperately searching for book deals and rapidly supplementing his TBR pile or trying to find the best background and angle for his bookstagram photos</div>

        <div class="masthead-text">A Physics undergraduate student in her second year at Delhi University, Ira is an ardent reader and a crazy chocolate lover with a yearning to explore new facets of life. She has a genuine interest in exploring cultures around her and believes that people are beautiful. Ira’s favourite de-stressers are baking and watching cheesy action movies. Her favourite pastime is scouring the internet for all the wonderful online courses she wants to do and then never opening those bookmarked pages again.</div>

        <div class="masthead-subtitle">Staff Supervisor</div>
        <div class="masthead-text">Majoring in economics, Govind is a melange of fickle passions. With his childhood sheltered in Kolkata, he never gets over his love for the life of that city even though he spent his adolescence in Bokaro and is now residing in the national capital. Gulzar and his lyrics lure him the most and he can listen to Yaman Kalyan for hours, even though he can never sing a line in tune. Govind loves the company of himself and watches doggo videos on Instagram. Narcissist? Not quite.</div>

        <div class="masthead-text">Aqdas, majoring in Economics, is currently in his second year of undergraduate study. A quiet observer of the world in its rapid motion, he is often found on the sidelines. Caught between trying to make sense of the economy and his dreams of becoming a movie star, all he can manage are half-baked jokes and awkward hellos. An introvert with love for Messi, and “samosa and chai” unbound, he tries to reflect life around him in his writing and hopes to travel the world someday.</div>

        <div class="masthead-text">Damini Sarma, a second year student, is pursuing Geology at the University of Delhi. Spending most of her time around rocks, she finds the essence of a life “more lived” through words, which at times she likes to compliment with her photographs. Damini has been writing since she was in Class V. She visits the world of words in both ups and downs - mostly downs before poetry pulls her up. With the dream of writing a “Her Story” someday, Damini also wants to venture and capture the world, and some hearts, through her lens.</div>

        <div class="masthead-text">Devika is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Zoology from the University of Delhi. An aesthete, she fills her small universe with paints and poems. A lover of portraiture, she finds meditative joy in giving shades to wrinkles, eyes, and smiles. Being one of a twin, Devika has been competitive from birth and enjoys taking up challenges. She believes that the biggest of dreams are small enough to conquer. From travelling the world with her paintings to DNA editing, one day she hopes to have done them all.

He enjoys reading, blowing things up in video games, and playing the violin. Born in Bengal and brought up in Dehradun, he has a soft spot for everything that has remotely to do with the mountains or Bengali culture. An inveterate weeb, Sagar would snort the entire nation of Japan if he could. When he isn’t sleeping, he’s generally watching whatever weird stuff YouTube recommends to him (read Cat videos) or desperately trying to catch up with his ever expanding to-be-watched anime pile.</div>

        <div class="masthead-text">You will find this second year Literature student in the shady areas of Malka Gunj and Kamla Nagar, petting dogs. His love for dogs is equivalent to his love for travel and writing. He considers himself an amateur when it comes to the field of writing. The one dream he wants to turn into reality is to change the world with his words.</div>
