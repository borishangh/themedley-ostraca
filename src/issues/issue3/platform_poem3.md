A cow shits lazily at your entrance.

Several other media plug into you like
you’re a giant, heaving, living spikebuster
like you’re a diabetic heart on the verge of cardiac arrest.

I ascend your steps with the lazy confidence of familiarity.

Others do not share this with me.

This place throngs with frightened microbes
who pat their left and right pockets to see
if anyone’s stolen their wallets and phones.

None of them trust each other.
All of them trust you.

I am not here to go anywhere. You
are not a means to an end nicer than You
are not grimy heat I must suffer through. You
are everything to me.

You’ll find me by the enquiries office
drinking cheap tea and looking away from the moon.

I am only here for you.
