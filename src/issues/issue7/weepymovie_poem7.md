I must admit that,
at the end of the movie,
my eyes moistened
behind my glasses.
I didn’t want my wife to see.
So I surreptitiously
made out to scratch my chin
while, at the same time,
nudged my fingers a little higher
so that they wiped away
as much of the tears as they could.
I risked a glimpse in her direction
and figured her eyes must
have been watching a different film
because they were as dry
as the Kalahari.
She said she saw the film
as manipulative.
But, then again, I love poetry.
I appreciate a good manipulation.
