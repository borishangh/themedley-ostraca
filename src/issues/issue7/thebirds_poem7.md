*'There’s music in the sighing of a reed;*
*There’s music in the gushing of a rill,*
*There’s music in all things,*
*If men had ears: Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.’*
									– Lord Byron

They penetrate the dawn. 
Their fast forward rhythm 
Blinkers the blue sky, 
Aching my eyes as I look

They float upwards, forwards, back 
In a see-saw fashion,
And play with the wind 
Through their feathers

Their fast paced action 
Is minimal and rehearsed, 
They own the blue above; 
Opposite their deep water sisters

Tin-can machines 
Cannot compete, 
Cutting heavily through air 
Flying, but not free.
