bio: "Going back and forth with the twists and turns of life, Surbhi can be seen taking refuge in the stories of the people and attempting to shift  perspective through their lens. On days, she would just be a lone wolf in the corner playing with the lyrics of Taylor Swift's songs. On other days, she hangs around with immense excitement and daredevilry at its fullest."

When in September sunshine
The yellowing leaves mounded over our memories
Under the beautifully painted tree
It made a noisy rustling
Humming sweet talks
When the world was still a magnificent dream . . .
Under the blanket shade of date palms
Rosy sunshine rained on us back and forth
The seeds fell in harmony
The world was not yet awake
At the lustrous dawn
We slipped into each other's hearts . . .
I close my teary eyes leading to a vaulted tree
That world was a debilitating dream
The yellowed leaves and fallen seeds laid bare
As someone crushed the two ants parting way
The tear trickled down my cheek . . .
