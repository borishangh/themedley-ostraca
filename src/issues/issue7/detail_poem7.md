I pick at the bud,
knowing I’ll kill.
Peel, peel, peel
what’s not ready.

Tight, upright,
waiting for suns
that will not come,
you sit. Stubborn.

I nip at your core,
splice your heart,
in order to understand
the anatomy of grief.

You don’t budge.
Through sediment,
settlements of souls,
I investigate, operate.

Cut by cut,
I slice, dissect,
open sesame, rip
skin full of scabs.

You allow me in.
I peel, peel, peel.
Bring autumn justice.
Strip layer upon layer.

I shred you into strings,
theories of everythings.
You smile, find breath.
Your secret safe from me.
