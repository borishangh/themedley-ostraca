bio: "Priyanshi Sharma is a 19 year old,who although claims to love poetry and writing,only occasionally delves into writing them when her thoughts cannot but spill all over and encompass her mind completely. You will mostly, find her looking at abstract unachievable art while she staggers on her daily schedule or just listening to piano playlists while waiting for autumn to fall."

They don't know the depth of a preserved pain hid in a chest like a pickle, 
it turns sour every passing season 
and I think of the silhouettes of those on the dilapidated alley 
where they would meet how many would they become two or four? or ne 
and the zest of orange lingers on the end of my tongue 
like I would wail any second or gulp it down in the other 
thinking of the childhood innocence of welcoming your sibling 
as they return from a long ride, to hop on the backseat 
to breathe in the freshness of an October evening

It smells like smoke 
like air mingling with the dust on stagnant leaves 
the ones left, the ones fallen 
the air smells sweet 
Too sweet perhaps as if seducing me of the sweetness that exists outside 
while dust settles on my lungs 
debarring it of breath 

Raindrops stuck on leaves, 
inside flowers 
putting blemishes on them as if infecting their lives
the morning holds a new stiller silence 
chattering chaos heard but distant 

The sky turns from dark to deep sea blue 
and now to the sea itself 
slowly I see its reflection on the white marble 
a blue light 
as if the torch bearer of the sun 
I think, I believe and then I yield 
the sun sheds no warmth 
no light transcends a darkness denuded prevails within me 
like the winter dew quivering with flakes 
it paralyses my insides, 
a numb me thus lain 
I wish believing was the only necessity 
my reason soughing anywhere except within.
