        <div class="masthead-text">Areeb Ahmad is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in English Literature from Delhi University. Although he is an eclectic bookworm, he swears by all things SFF with Erikson as God and Malazan as Gospel. He is currently interning as an associate member for Feeding India, a non-profit organisation which primarily redistributes extra leftover food acquired through donations to the needy. Areeb has been writing since he was in sixth grade and would really like to finally finish working on a book of his own one of these days. He can be found desperately searching for book deals and rapidly accumulating his TBR pile.</div>

        <div class="masthead-subtitle">Prose Reader</div>
        <div class="masthead-text">Satyam Srivastava is a second-year Chemistry student at Hansraj College, University of Delhi. Like many of us, he started writing poems for his high-school crush. After an expected failure there, he moved on to different themes and other ideas. He is a sports enthusiast and practices air-rifle shooting at an amateur level. His prime interests lie in literature, music, and spirituality. Lately he has also developed a liking for Hollywood movies and binges on them frequently.</div>

        <div class="masthead-subtitle">Prose Reader</div>
        <div class="masthead-text">Majoring in economics, Govind is a melange of fickle passions. With his childhood sheltered in Kolkata, he never gets over his love for the life of that city even though he spent his adolescence in Bokaro and is now residing in the national capital. Gulzar and his lyrics lure him the most and he can listen to Yaman Kalyan for hours, even though he can never sing a line in tune. Govind loves the company of himself and watches doggo videos on Instagram. Narcissist? Not quite.</div>

        <div class="masthead-text">Sanghmitra Jethwani is a third-year English Literature student at Hansraj College, Delhi University. On most days, she tries to capture the tales recited by the streets of Delhi through her lens, to find stories and faces that have been buried for too long. On others, she attempts to find the meaning of life in between the lines of Urdu poetry, believing one day she eventually will. She revels in her constant confusion, grappling with new ideas while listening to old Bollywood songs.</div>

        <div class="masthead-subtitle">Poetry Reader</div>
        <div class="masthead-text">Bukowski says, “You won’t see him often, for wherever the crowd is, he is not.” Sarthak is pursuing an undergraduate degree in Economics from Hansraj College, University of Delhi. He is a self-proclaimed musical snob, a coffee aficionado and a gamer. He is into poetry (evidently) and seeks art, cine and music as inspiration. Sarthak is often desperately holding onto memories for ‘a lifetime in repeat.’ He is a featured photographer at Unsplash and he’s never not wearing headphones.</div>

        <div class="masthead-text">Vidushi Arya is a first-year student of Commerce at Hansraj College. Of the few things which are absolutely necessary for a happy life, she considers coffee, reading, music and heart-to-heart conversations the basic requirements. With a love for words and colours that go beyond the horizon, she spends her days trying to match balance sheets and memorising lyrics of her favourite pop songs. She firmly believes that a long walk can solve more problems than a heated discussion.</div>
