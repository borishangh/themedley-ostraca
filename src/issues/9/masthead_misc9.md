        <div class="masthead-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief</div>
        <div class="masthead-text">Borishan Ghosh is a 2nd year  physics major from Bengal. A conversation with him at any given time will include rants about the profundity of math as an art, praise for David Foster Wallace, and maybe a poem recital or two. He draws, he writes, and he solves. But most importantly, he strives <i>to know</i>.

        <div class="masthead-text">Harini is a 2nd year undergraduate from the Department of Anthropology. She divides her time between drama, dance, poetry and debate. It's only fitting that she finds herself surrounded by fossils and skulls, or brooding over whodunnit mystery novels(her favourite). On her free days you might find her strolling around and across the North Campus or absolutely owning the podium at debate competitions.</div>

        <div class="masthead-text">Shatakshi is a student of Geology. In her two years of college, she has volunteered in projects left and right bringing more attention to issues of the environment and the people of the tiny-big city of Delhi. This is not to say that she doesn't also have an eye for photography and a hand for writing. Between the constant search of sponsors, writers, deadlines and internships, she has always some time for a late-night walk</div>
