Narcissi and snowdrops flaunt
their primal sexual purpose.
You urge me to photograph them
before tomorrow’s storm crushes
their elaborate little blossoms.
 
I’m more concerned that the snow
will crush me, crush my spirit
in a vast, slow-moving gloom,
crush my body under hemlocks
collapsed by the wet sticky weight.
 
You ignore my unmanly fear
and feed the cats their breakfast
without considering how small
I’ve become with age, easy prey.
Still, if we survive this week 

together we might smile away
the exhausted tropes of winter
and replace them with April thoughts
that despite their crude aesthetic
will warm us together again.
