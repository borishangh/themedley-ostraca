There are those that say
that, in these searing temperatures,
you could fry an egg
on the pavement.
Another reckons
it’s the fault of humankind,
how we’ve gone
and wrecked the weather.
And third just figures
one man’s heat
is another man’s beach-time.
And a fourth merely asks,
“Why is there never a consensus?”
The subject’s exhausted
but then a fifth shows up.
The other four gag him.
