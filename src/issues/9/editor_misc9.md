In the beginning of April, *The Medley* team decided to go forward with "Debris" as a theme for this issue. We hoped to accomodate every writer who'd entrust us with their work, without being too grim or too trivializing of the uncertain times.

It is of note that often despite our extensive histories, poems and stories written amidst wars there is only a limited note of the like in plagues and famines. Not all wars and not all people though can have the same said about them. Perhaps the power in remembering is not just good luck or our desperation. A good indicator of our persistence during these times is whether the pots still carried art, whether the people kept singing or the writers writing.

More than ever it is important to write of hope, not as a device of fiction but as a very real antiseptic to complacency. Centuries later, the only discriminator that remained of simple debris and a history were the pots, the songs and the work of writers. The debris on our screens is a reminder to speak plainly of these things and keep speaking. Through this issue, we celebrate in the smallest of ways, the importance of holding safe whatever was spoken.

Our ninth issue features poems, fiction and essays from many corners of the world, and an interview of esteemed author Nilanjana Roy. It is a labour of love from the few of us and we remain deeply humbled by everyone who sent us their work and lent us their attention. We hope you like it.

*Warmly,*
*The Medley*
