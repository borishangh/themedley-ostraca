Last summer, as my days in Delhi were coming to an end, allowing myself to stay indoors was becoming difficult. Despite the scorching heat of Delhi, I ventured out as much as possible and on one such day, found myself in Mehrauli. Situated in the southwestern part of Delhi, it is one of Delhi’s seven medieval cities- a timeless tapestry with monuments and ancient ruins hidden in every corner.

I wandered around the archaeological park on my own without any sign boards or guides, feeling like an explorer lost in the wheel of time. The summertime bloom of Delhi *amaltas* trees and the lush greenery added a new dimension to the architectural beauty of the place, making it a perfect picnic spot for families. Despite the heat, there were locals enjoying themselves and children playing cricket unaware that a part of Mehrauli’s soul would soon be lost with the demolition of a centuries-old mosque by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA)

Now, as Mehrauli Archaeological Park undergoes restoration and beautification, I fear that my first experience there will never be recreated. Will local children still play cricket? Will I lose myself in the heart of the city again? What else will change or be demolished in the process? I do not know.

I am grateful to my past self for visiting that day despite the heat and for taking this picture with my nearly dead phone battery. Amidst the changes, this photograph will keep reminding me of the scent of the ancient stones, the sun rays embracing every structure and how beautifully *amaltas* were in bloom that day.
