Lavrov is waiting at the gangway of the plane,
a special guest will come to the house with a visit,
he will stroke a tie, a guest invited will eat goodies.
 
What kind of guest? Don’t you know?
Certainly, it is not a leader from the EU,
the Russian battleship Pansa  rushed for cash.
 
The barking whip weaves scary tales,
Hungarians are oppressed by the hated Union,
Putin drinks a glass of wine, Orban is his trump card.
 
It turns out that there are such «Nazis»
by class and level of  luxury – «European level»,
they occupied Vienna on the tanks,
animals are tortured, stories are heavy.
 
Orban tears his shirt for Russian "cash",
a powerful rush for weapons,
of course, you will not object.
