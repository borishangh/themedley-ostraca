bio: "Verite Kishore is a Thiruvananthapuram-bred second-year student of Ramjas College, University of Delhi. He is the type to write for reasons real and imagined, a tendency which has, along the way, made him a twice-published author. In his free time, Verite laments about his lack of free time, which inevitably leaves him with - you guessed it - no free time."

When I was a child, I had a friend 
He told me every single little thing; 
Of how he was scared the world would end 
And how he wanted to be king. 

Wherever he went, we were always together 
In school, at home, or on the ground; 
Come hell or high water, we swore to each other 
We’d never let the other down. 

I’d laugh at his stories, but had none of mine to tell 
He’d tell me sometimes, “Come on, now, your turn”; 
I’d sit there blankly, and he’d say, “Oh, well” 
And go on without further concern.

 Little wonder, then, that I soon found myself alone 
And I have only myself to blame; 
Once he found others who had stories of their own 
It never was quite the same. 

When he was a child, he had no friends 
So I popped up in his head; But he grew up, 
and I couldn’t jump that fence 
And I, never alive, was left for dead.
