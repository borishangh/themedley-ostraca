<pre>
after all is said
	and done, we’re left
	with flotsam and jetsam.
to have devolved
	this much
	was nothing
we reckoned for.
	separately, we’d been 
	intact and got along
swimmingly, each
	with the other, buoyancy
	unimpeded and loss 
of ballast nowhere in the calculation
	but a reckoning,
	unexpected, uninvited
found its way
	to our respective hatches
	and we were at its mercy.
of a sudden, we had neither
	hope nor wish
	for reconciliation or truce.
we’re long dispersed,
	detritus excreted in our wake,
	and have surrendered
the present tense,
	in favor of ancient
	unchanging history,
good for nothing but sifting
	through for, at best,
	the remnant of better days.
