If there is a book on all reputable lists
You're the first to find it and declare
It is the one to read this book you appropriate
As nearly one you wrote yourself
 
You purpose great books to self aggrandize
In disguise you advocate seemingly selflessly
For its excellence perhaps in hope 
That the conclusion drawn by all 
 
Is that the excellence is all yours 
And your ability to award to those
You deem worthy of your attention
And your inflated self will compete
 
For a place on the chart you keep 
Inventing to pad your reputation
Honed to mean you are in fact 
The one and only anything and everything
