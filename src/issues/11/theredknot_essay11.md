Aba - Nigeria, July, 1966.
The courthouse loomed like a concrete coffin. The flame trees in the compound wept crimson. Inside, our parents would carve up their marriage. Our father, Npa-anyi, drove six of us in his Citroën DS 19, his driver and shadow, Marcus, gripping the wheel. He parked under the flame trees, crushing their fallen leaves. We waited. Our mother, Nma-anyi, arrived alone – her pregnant belly, a soft curve under her george wrapper. The courthouse gate swallowed her whole, like a stone sinking in Nwangele River. Npa-anyi hurriedly left for the courtroom with us in tow.

Kwemdi, Adaure, and Ularinma sat rigid in school uniforms—holy communion white, crumpled from morning assembly. Npa-anyi had pulled them mid-class. "Family emergency," he  told their headmaster. Only Law-Law, Frank, and I were unbound by classrooms, too young for school rigours. Inside the courtroom, voices rose like hornets—“irretrievable breakdown,” “custody,” and “maintenance" were hammering the final nails into our parents' marriage. 

The judge ordered, "Remove the children!" 

We stumbled into the white-hot noon. My gaze stuck. A woman. Alone in the front seat of our Citroën. She sat perfectly still, profile calm, observing the chaos of Factory Road – the rattling mammy wagons, the women crossing the road with shopping baskets, and the shouts of touts, with a terrifying patience. As if she was waiting for a bus, not the dissolution of a family. A red purse sat on her laps and a silk scarf, crimson as fresh palm oil, knotted tightly under her chin—framed her face. Two loose ends fluttered like warning flags. While our parents dissected their marriage inside the courtroom, outside, in our car, the red knot waited patiently.  
Marcus stared at his shoes, avoided our questioning eyes. 

“Who is she?”  
The question died in my throat. Her stillness was absolute—a spider in the centre of our unravelling web.  
The judge’s gavel echoed. Npa-anyi emerged alone, jaw clenched. His gaze darted to the front seat. Without a word, he drove—not home, but northwest toward Umuaka. The red knot with her insufferable perfume, was still in the car. Adaure, Ularinma and I sat at the back seat. Betrayal breathed in silk and silence. The red scarf burned my eyes.
 
“Are we not fetching Nma-anyi? Where are we going?” Ularinma dared ask.  
“She will go on her own.”    
“Where are Kwemdi, Law-Law and Frank?” I voiced lightly.
Npa-anyi stiffened. “Don’t worry about them, Omalicha,” he said irritably.


We were fleeing Aba and the smouldering ruins of our family. Suddenly, it started raining. The Citroën sliced through the countryside. Plantain and banana trees lined the red dirt road to Umuaka, their broad leaves slapping against each other under the intensity of the July rains. To me, pressed against the window, these trees seemed like a gauntlet of green hands—waving, beckoning, or perhaps warning. 
 
“Turn back,” they whispered as they bent and parted. “Nothing good waits here.” 
 
But the car pushed forward, deeper into the green tunnel. Miss sat confidently, her scarlet knot a beacon in the gloom. The perfume had faded, replaced by the sour tang of sweat and something else—something metallic, like a newly drawn blade. I whimpered at the thought of what may have become of Kwemndu, Law-Law and Frank. Adaure reached across and squeezed my hand, her touch the only warmth in the unnerving voyage. 
 
Outside, the trees kept waving. Oblivious. Now complicit. They were unsympathetic to the knot tightening around us. The relentless jungle kept closing in. Now and then, the plantain and banana trees embraced the road like prison guards. As we drove deeper into isolation, fronds parted reluctantly to reveal Miss's new domain. Their bruised leaves wept sticky sap onto the windshield - tears we couldn't shed. 

"Where are we going?" Ularinma demanded again.  

"Your new home," Miss said, smiling at Npa-anyi.  

Umuaka received us in silence. Miss’s new residence, a bungalow, crouched under palms, was half-eaten by jungle. Ngozi, her niece, met us with ice in her stare. “Welcome," she lied. Her gape said “intruders.” 

Npa-anyi left before dusk. He never stayed. Every Friday, Miss packed her vanity case. Evening in Paris perfume trailed her like a ghost. Marcus drove her to him in Aba. "Behave well, little bastards," she’d smirk, leaving us with garri, thin soup and silence - hunger and fear. 

Nights bled terror. Pythons slid from the bush thicket, their skin gleaming like spilled crude oil.

"Éké!" Ularinma screamed one early Sunday morning, vaulting onto the table. 
 
Ngozi shrugged. "Sacred here. Don’t offend them."  

She’d step over the coiled mass like it was furniture. To villagers, pythons were totems—guardians. To us? Omens. They mirrored Miss’s departures and returns—silent, cold, tightening around our throats.  

Alone, the house breathed. We foraged for mangoes, whispered stories of Nma-anyi, wondered what became of our brothers, jumped at rustling leaves. But Sundays, Miss returned—at little or no provocation, dangling Nma-anyi’s name like rotten fruit, cruelty sharpened by absence.  
Later, we learnt that Miss had sought for a transfer—"To nurse sick mother," she told colleagues who had begged her to stop the affair. We realised that Umuaka’s isolation was her shield against gossip and judgement from Abba community. The isolation was strategic—a fresh start where no one knew: 
 
&emsp;&emsp;Her Holy Rosary Primary School colleagues couldn’t judge.  
&emsp;&emsp;Our grandmother, Mamakeukwu, couldn’t intervene.
&emsp;&emsp;Umuaka community only saw "Miss Moli’s" respectable façade.  

The divorce decree shattered us like a calabash dropped on stone and scattered us: we would also later realise that while Adaure, Ularinma, and I were marched to Umuaka to stay with Miss, Law-Law and Frank were exiled to live with Mamakeukwu in Abba. Kwemndu was dispatched to Santana Boarding Primary School in Awonmama.  

Long vacation brought fragile reunion to our country home in Abba. Mamakeukwu was happy we were all home but scrutinised our malnourished frames. Marcus had picked us from Umuaka, made a detour and fetched Kwemndu from Awonmama. Kwemndu returned with boarding school tales of how he and his school mates were unable to eat most times because heads of human skeletons fell through the Dining Hall roof into their plates. We believed him. Law-Law and Frank—bright-eyed—listened.

Npa-anyi arrived in the evening, a Lagos transfer letter peeking from his suit pocket. "Promotion," he’d boasted, though his eyes avoided Adaure’s emaciated hands.  

The next day, Ularinma, was cleaning Npa-anyi’s Study when she unearthed a letter dated 16th February 1965 in cursive handwriting addressed to Npa-anyi. It was an invitation to a sendoff party. The writer also asked after Winnie and her children and signed off with, “Chudi, your Moli longs for you.” Ularinma showed us her discovery and we were baffled. The lies. "She didn’t know he was married,” but  her former colleagues at Holy Rosary school would later rumour, “but we saw Marcus slide notes into Miss’s hand, watched her tuck them into her bra like stolen jewels.”  

Unknown to us, two pregnancies shadowed the divorce: Nma-anyi’s, a desperate hope amidst despair, and Miss’s, the secret engine of her swift installation. When Miss’s belly began to swell, barely three months after the divorce, her cruelty sharpened. Our hunger deepened, justified by her need. "The baby requires nourishment," she’d declare, taking the choicest bits of meat for herself, leaving us scraps and bones.


“How and where did they even meet?”  Ularinma whispered to Mamakeukwu.

"During his visits to check on me. Your father’s work suits and ‘blue-chip airs’ made villagers magnify his modest salary into fortune. Miss saw ‘prey.’ What does a young woman like that want from a married man with six children, and a seventh on the way?”

Ularinma’s eyes widened. “They said she was not aware that Npa-anyi was married with children but she knew Nma-anyi’s name and even asked after us, God will judge her!” 

“I warned him about her but he beat me severely, I almost died.” Mamakeukwu looked pained.


For days, laughter almost drowned the past. Then fevers struck.  Law-Law shivered, Frank burned like embers while I shook beneath Mamakeukwu bedsheet.  Npa-anyi’s Citroën raced to Amaigbo Hospital, Miss’s red purse glowing like a hazard light on her lap.  

The hospital reeked of bleach and despair. Nuns floated through overcrowded wards. In the fluorescent glare:  

&emsp;&emsp;Law-Law whimpered on plastic chairs, Adaure cradling his head.  
&emsp;&emsp;Frank lay across Npa-anyi’s lap, breaths rattling like stones in a tin.  
&emsp;&emsp;I sat on a bench, trying to resist the urge to stretch out on the floor.  

When they took Frank behind swinging doors, Miss clutched her purse. "Poor boy," she muttered to the nurse.  

Frank never returned.  

Few hours later, a doctor emerged. "I’m sorry,” he informed Npa-anyi, “The child is gone."  

Miss’s wail tore the air: "Chineke! Blood of Jesus!"  
Npa-anyi collapsed against the wall, great heaving sobs shook his shoulders. I stared at Miss’s red purse abandoned on the chair—crimson as courthouse silk, bright as fresh blood.  

Frank was buried in the red earth of Abba, a tiny mound under a brutal sun. At the graveside, broken, Npa-anyi collapsed again and wept. Miss sobbed performatively, clutching her own swelling belly. She tried pulling him up, "Control yourself, Chudi." Ularinma, crushed, spat at Miss's shoes: "Let him cry! You killed Frank with your neglect!" Miss's slap echoed across the compound. Npa-anyi didn't intervene... The red knot tightened around my heart, now stained with irrevocable loss.

Mamakeukwu consoled us. She explained that Frank simply left through the fever, that he would still have left even without any fever. She said that Frank has a rare peaceful personality and his type cannot thrive in a family where rancour or animosity reigns. She said that the renowned medicine man had warned about this consequence several times when Nma-anyi and Npa-anyi quarrelled over non-existent official tours that Npa-anyi  had used as an excuse to go on escapades with Miss. Npa-anyi ignored the warnings. Now, it’s too late. 

In the evening, we saw him alone at the grave, whispering to the mound. Ulari watched, stone-faced. "Crying won't bring Frank back, you were warned – you failed him!" Mamakeukwu said you should leave that boy alone to rest in peace.
 

After Frank’s burial, Npa-anyi left for Lagos. He said he would come for us and Miss after he had settled in his new location. We didn’t linger. We were hauled back to Umuaka. Kwemndu stayed in Abba waiting for school to reopen, shoulders permanently hunched. Law-Law continued to stay with Mamakeukwu, eyes hollow.

At Umuaka, Miss’s cruelty sharpened. Her spite curdled in the humid air - the fractures became canyons; she couldn’t visit Npa-anyi every Friday. Lagos is far. "Smart rogues," she’d hiss in frustration. "Stressful bastards!" 
 
Adaure lowered her eyes, face expressionless. Ularinma glared at Miss’s retreating back, fingers curling into fists that promised retribution. Days bled into a grim routine: 
 
&emsp;&emsp;Miss locked the pantry, humming as she ate fried plantains. 
 
&emsp;&emsp;Pythons slide beneath the door, drawn by the scent of our hunger.
  
&emsp;&emsp;Ularinma stood guard with a broom, a small sentinel against slithering shadows.

&emsp;&emsp;In silence, Adaure mended school uniforms by lamplight, stitches precise as surgical sutures. 
  
When Ularinma seethed, "I’ll burn her stupid scarves!" Adaure murmured, "Don’t do that." Her patience wasn’t surrender—it was preservation. I learned this from her: how to fold rage into something small and survivable, how to make silence a sanctuary.  

One by one, we all left for secondary school. Boarding school, Abbot Girls Secondary School in Anambra State, pried the knot loose. Now, I lived away from Miss. Sharing a dormitory with Imelda, who came from a loving home, was revelatory. 

One rainy night, haunted by the anniversary of Frank’s death, the story spilled out – the scarf, the starvation, Miss’s venom, Frank’s rattling breath. Saying the words aloud, hearing Imelda’s horrified gasp, "Omalicha! That woman is wicked! Starving you? A baby died?" was terrifying and cathartic. The red knot loosened slightly with the sharing of its weight. "You survived that?" Imelda whispered, holding my hand. "You are so strong." Her words planted a seed of defiance.

I had packed only blue and white clothing to school. One Saturday, Imelda offered me a scarlet ribbon for Visiting Day. I refused.  
“Suit yourself,” she shrugged, tying it around her own wrist. That simple, friendly gesture—red not as threat but as gift—etched a new possibility.

During the Station of the Cross at Odoata Parish, Imelda noticed my flinch.  
“You dislike red, Omalicha?”  
I nodded.  
“Look again,” she said, pointing to the window. “Red is also heart, love, life. Without it, that glass would be dull.”  
Next visit, during Good Friday Liturgy, I noticed the stained-glass crucifix glowed ruby when afternoon sun hit it, but in that light - the colour felt warm, not cruel.  
University of Calabar completed the slow untying of the knot. Elective courses in Psychology and Philosophy handed me names: narcissistic abuse, gas-lighting, food deprivation as control. Words became knives to cut old bonds. Classes became therapy sessions. Over time, the flashbacks dulled.
In 2000, on a visit to the Southeast, I went to Abba. The Central Market pulsed with new life, a kaleidoscope of colours and sounds. Shops buzzed with generators, streets smelled of fried akara, roasted plantain and fresh paint. Silk hair-pieces fluttered like restless spirits in the harmattan wind. My daughter, now five, scurried past stalls piled with stuffs. She pointed to a sleek red sash.  

“That one, Mommy. It’s beautiful!”  her hands were already claiming it, silk pooling like liquid fire in her palms. In that blaze of red reborn, the knot untied itself—the ends free as forgiveness.
I smiled and bought it.  
In one fluid motion, she tied it across her forehead.   
“How do I look?”  
“Radiant,” I said—and meant it.  
The red knot, once a chokehold, is now a ribbon on a child’s head. The colour that bruised my childhood has become a shade in life’s full spectrum.

The red knot remains. A scar on the soul. A sudden flash of red  can still trigger a micro-flinch, a ghost of the old terror. But it no longer binds. It’s a fossil, preserved in the annals of that July afternoon, inescapably tied to Aba – the courthouse, fallen flame tree leaves, the metallic air, the woman waiting patiently to dismantle a world. It speaks of Frank, of hunger, of whispered cruelties, of a father’s blindness, and a stepmother’s venom disguised as piety. But the loose ends, once framing her face like a trap, now symbolise the unravelling I achieved. 

The knot held trauma, but it couldn't contain the whole story. The Blood, once a tool of manipulation, now signifies the stubborn, miraculous life-force – my own, my siblings – that bled, endured, and ultimately flowed beyond the confines of that carefully tied, poisonous silk. The red earth of Abba holds Frank, but it also holds the roots of my resilience.

I am Omalicha. I survived Miss. The red knot is part of my map, but has ceased to be my destination.
