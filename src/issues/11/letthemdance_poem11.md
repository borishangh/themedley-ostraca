In my country women are defined 
As pure, divine and safe
Only when draped in red.

A stream of tears flows down my cheek
When I behold most widows—
They’ve lost their laal, 
The secret blush of married life.

I weep in corners 
When I see bare foreheads—
No vermilion,
No laal sari,
No laal smile blooming on lips—
A life without body, without soul.

If laal indicates danger, why not the rose?
If laal in traffic means stop, why not love?

Shall widows not feel laal?
Shall they not wear laal?
Shall they not sit beside another 
Wrapped in laal?

A world beyond laal is colourless.
Let them dance in laal, hara, peela and all.
