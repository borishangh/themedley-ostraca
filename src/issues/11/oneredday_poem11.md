Our friends’ daughter
in a closed coffin—
 
I rerun their Christmas Eve party—
Pamela sitting on the floor
in red dress and red shoes,
her red smile fed by sweetness.
 
Dark eyes and white teeth
flash greetings to incoming guests
as she reads a gift-storybook
to her three-year-old Holly.
 
Crowding her parents’ buffet table—
homemade lasagna, oysters on the half-shell,
glazed ham, jumbo shrimp—
amid oriental rugs, bronze sculptures,
champagne glasses clink.
 
Friends are warmed
by the thermal weave of 
sister, Mom, Dad, husband-John
filling our plates and glasses.
 
            * * * 
 
Christmas Day, en route from another party,
a driver, mad at John’s 
middle finger response to taunts
shoots through Pamela’s window.
 
Radiance of a lit Christmas tree shorted.
Holly sits in a growing pool of red.
John screams, *Help me, He shot my princess.*
*Someone help me.  He shot my princess.*
