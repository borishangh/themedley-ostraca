Nam was raging
The carrier sat off shore
lobbing volkswagens at precise targets
targets selected by trained photo surveillance analysts
of which my friend was one.
 
We kept in close touch&emsp;me in the states 
him on that floating city&emsp;A lot of the time
he played baseball with the crew on the massive hanger deck
went for a fly ball one afternoon&emsp;ran off the deck backwards
and somehow managed to grab a guard rope.

The jets on their elevator pad were a long way down
It would have been messy.
 
Shore leave kept the boys in Thai stick
but risky&emsp;firing up on board&emsp;Small observation balconies
let you slip out&emsp;keep the door propped open with your boot
watch the sea go by&emsp;the sun set over the jungle&emsp;the roach burn down
Damn Thai was Strong!&emsp;Easy to get lost in the … reverie
 
He happened to glance to the bow one eve
just as a huge wave was sweeping the starboard beam
cresting maybe a dozen feet over his head   Jerked back inside
the wave hit the door&emsp;the door slammed shut&emsp;and tossed him back
like a tackle&emsp;burying a quarterback.

Day after day
week on week&emsp;for a couple three months
looking at high-res black and white images   searching for jungle trails
clearings&emsp;huts&emsp;anything out of the ordinary&emsp;Occasionally
something of actual military interest   Equipment!&emsp;Squads!
 
Then he spotted his first anti-aircraft placement
when the winds had blown their camo off	and the plane’s camera
picked up glare off the metal   Out came the stamp   and that numbered photo
with its little red circle
went over in *that* pile&emsp;to be collected by targeting specialists
and translated into bombing coordinates.
 
Recon was sweeping south to north&emsp;shore to mountains.
The enemy gunnery installations	and guerilla troop movements
got more frequent&emsp;as did the numbered photos
with their little red circles
But a dozen hours a day peering through a stereoscope got Borrr-ring!
and a guy had to struggle hard&emsp;just to stay awake&emsp;much less alert.
 
The job naturally evolved into a competition
who on their watch could spot and file the most photo targets
Eventually&emsp;boredom won and the competition   became a game
Soon&emsp;*anything* other than flat jungle   was fair game
for planting another&emsp;little red circle.
 
He got *good* at the game&emsp;his rep spread
and The Powers that Be promoted him   from pre-bombing surveillance
to post-bombing analysis&emsp;Then for the next couple months
he got to read the very detailed and quite often gory reports
of in-field damage assessments.
 
And match the post photos with pre photos.
Some of which he had personally filed&emsp;Many of which
showed blown-apart target areas	with absolutely *nothing* military about them
Clusters of huts&emsp;A small school&emsp;What was once a town’s medical service
Remnants of gardens and planted fields   of dismembered livestock.

Bodies of people&emsp;or what was left of them
Men and women&emsp;And children.

As the carnage grew&emsp;the direct linkages of his own playful gaming
to the resultant collateral damage&emsp;became all too frequent&emsp;When he asked
his pastor assured him that what looked like simple villages&emsp;were instead
where the enemy fighters hid&emsp;Those people   that appeared to be farmers and school children
were carrying automatic rifles and setting explosives along trails&emsp;After all&emsp;all’s fair …

He said it was the constant replay of high-res B&Ws on his brainpan that did it
Then about two years into his term of service   he broke.
