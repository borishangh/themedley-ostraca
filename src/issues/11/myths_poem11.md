While the children watch wide-eyed, her husband shoves
the gun barrel into my mother&#39;s mouth, finger on the trigger,
For years she becomes a new Cipactli – rough thick skin,
one hundred wide mouths of sharp white teeth gaping,
always hungry. She is created in this moment from
nothingness, the arch of her back a dousing rod finding
divinity in the space between stars. When the world begins,
her husband drives his foot into the dark soft skin of her
womb, he pries her open, hands tearing flesh, and the earth
springs fully formed from the wounds in her flesh, rivers
flowing from their source in the rich copper of her blood.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He creates thirteen heavens
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;from the shards of her skull.

&emsp;&emsp;Or he calls her by name,
his lessons a river of blood -- Huitzilopochtli cutting open
sisters, brothers, their blood spreading slick, crimson across
his knuckles, his angry hands ripping their flesh because
his mother, breasts a ball of hummingbird feathers,
had been raped.
Later she becomes Xochitl, flowers in her hair, learning
betrayal in the palms of pulque drunk hands, he holds her
brittle body against stones, she is spread wide – after
she is raped they blame wine, blame younger men, other
women take her place. Like Mayahuel, her breasts bleeding
thick honeyed sap as she nurses four hundred children, they
grow strong in Xochitl’s ruins as she is cut apart while they
watch. Afterward, exhausted and bloodied, she becomes
a warm body lying – finger shaped bruises quietly filling
with blood, red against russet thighs where she has been
pried open. Her smile stretches sharp white teeth, lips tight
&emsp;&emsp;around the flared head of his gun.
