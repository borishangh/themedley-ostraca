Leaving myself, I want to go somewhere
far away, but anywhere I go, my forehead
goes, goes my eye, voice, everything—inescapable
The walk, which I walk to leave them
they all go on that walk by my feet
How many times, how many tricks I find
to leave my bloody, raped, burnt body, but
I can’t. At least to get relief for a while from those
I try to sleep, look for the sovereignty of sleep
but anywhere I lie, my bloodied body lies
in me, bearing the unbearable pain, then
the nightmare haunts me, and into the turmoil
there’s also the torture, injustice, and infinite
violence, as in my awakened universe—they
hunt me for the feast of Westerners, as if I’m the
beast or bird of the Amazon forest; they are drunk
in the game of destruction with me, as I’m the mine
of coal or oil; they grind me like a lemon or orange
in the blender to exploit the labor of the proletariat
I struggle for freedom, struggle to get back
the fear-free birthplace of silk-cotton, coral tree forest
and corn fields, but there’s the historical
consequences of development: wasteland, massacre
lack of oxygen, I can’t breathe, in intense thirst, my
throat gets not a drop of pure water, even any vapor
In excruciating pain, eventually, I pray for nirvana
but it’s hell, really, I can never get the salvation
Nirvana or peace is merely a hypothesis
O death, now I try to cry for you—though
the cry is explosive, but it can’t burst
for a strange pressure hostage to violent silence—
I’ve to live with such a destiny!
