Red was the colour of my saree, 
the day I married my husband. 
A soldier by profession, my red was as deep as his love would prove to be. 

Red was the colour of the suitcase,
in which I placed the things,
which I was going to carry into this new chapter of my life.

Red was the colour of the door, 
that which gave way to his quarters.
It was rustic but strong, 
a gateway into this life.

Red was the colour of the ladies, 
who celebrated their Karwa Chauth together. 
A shared sisterhood, a family formed away from family. 

Red was the colour of my eyes, 
the first time I had to go and he had to stay. 
He assured me he would be fine, and I kept my tears at bay. 

Red was the colour of the rose, 
he sent me soon after. 
It's nothing in front of you, is what the note attached to it said. 

Red was the colour of the setting sun, 
the first time I looked into my son's eyes. 
The rose in the room was red, as I saw the first meeting between the two loves of my life. 

Red is the colour of my love, 
and that of every human.
And as Audrey Hepburn said, 
"There is a shade of red for every woman".
