    Issue #11 : Laal
  </h1>

  <div class="content-text">
    <p>
      Laal, or the colour Red, transcends the visual and enters abstraction, shows us multitudes â€” of fear, of shame, of grief. From a whimsical midnight thought, it unfolds into symbols, divergent meanings and layers. It shows us how red is, and never was, just a colour. A shade, which cut opens like an infinitely layered cake. The deeper you cut, the more it reveals.
