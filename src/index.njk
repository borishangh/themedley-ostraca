    Issue #9 : Debris
  </h1>

  <div class="content-text">
    <p>
      The first time some of us learnt the word was probably in a geography class — describing what processes weather and break down great rocks into sand and settle and become rock again. We might have learnt how it is sometimes cost-effective to leave broken satellites in orbit to become “space debris”, and how they still orbit our planet, forgotten.

      Lately the term has taken on an eerie ring, in descriptions of once lively cities of Palestine, Ukraine and Sudan. It comes out intermixed in stories of incredible cruelty and unimaginable courage. Still, it is difficult to name any other force of nature stronger than the human capacity to resist annihilation.

      For this issue of The Medley, we are looking for works of prose, poetry and non-fiction that take root in the loosened soil of these places.
