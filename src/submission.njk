    <h1 class="content-title">Concept Note</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Laal (लाल) translates to the colour Red. But red is, and never was, just a colour. From a midnight thought, it unfolds into symbols, diverging meanings and layers. It holds multitudes – fear, love, shame, dignity, trauma, and guilt. A colour shaped like a neverending layered cake: the deeper you cut, the more it reveals. From the faint pinks of a sun dipping below the skyline to the darkest shade of dried blood, Laal is never still. <br><br>
    Traditionally, Laal is romanticised as the colour of love, passion, and chemistry. Of burning connections - Of the rose pressed between pages after a first date, left to decay with time - Of the spilt wine of heartbreak on the wooden floors of a house once shared. But what happens when that love rots? When it’s rejected? Lost? When it turns on you? When it begins to haunt? <br><br>
    It is also the colour of dignity – both claimed and stripped. The Sindoor, worn in the parting of a woman’s hair. For some a choice, for others, a mark of sacrifice, of compulsion. The color of the bridal gown, of the bride bound to a man when her heart belonged to a woman. Of being promised a fairytale and receiving silence instead. It is the colour of quiet oppression, of stories swallowed, of identities forced to fold inwards. <br><br>
    Laal stains in other ways too; blemishes in the memory of a war survivor, who sees flashes of Laal every time their eyes shut, on bodies that carry histories never recorded. Blood that dried but never really disappeared. <br><br>
    Let this colour bleed into every form, every voice, every memory. Let it remain untamed.
